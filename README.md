Language: Java

Runtime: ~9500 ms (2024)

Every solution should work universally in similar runtime, with the exception of day 17 which is specifically hardcoded to my input

Many of the solutions have some pretty horrible code, especially some of the earlier days, so beware ðŸ‘»

Feel free to use this repo to help you with your own AoC solutions, however I might not be the best role model for good and efficient code lol
